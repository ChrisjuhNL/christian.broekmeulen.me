From now on my personal website will not be using [Middleman] as backend but [Jekyll].

I've decided to use Jekyll instead as I was working on Jekyll for other projects and found that it had a more clearer structure.
This and my old installation of Middleman was giving me a lot of dependencies problems, missing, outdated or to recent gems.
I don't know it seemed to me it would be easier to start from scratch then to fix all the issues.

<h2>HTTPS</h2>
I've also switched to the HTTPS protocol, I wanted to do this a long time already. I'm using the [LetsEncrypt] library which
gives me a free SSL/TLS certificate.

<h2>SEO</h2>
Lately I've been busy with SEO a lot in my personal projects focussing on things such as [AMP] but have neglected my personal website a bit.
I couldnt be bother re-doing my own website in [AMP] cause this would mean I would have to redo my whole styling as my stylesheet is way too long.
But I did do some minor changes, I mean; My website was missing a basic description on every page and my titles were even off these basics should be taken care of now.
